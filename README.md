# Data-Modeling-and-Analysis

COGS 109. Modeling and Data Analysis (4)

Exposure to the basic computational methods useful throughout cognitive science. Computing basic statistics, modeling learning individuals, evolving populations, communicating agents, and corpus-based linguistics will be considered.

COGS 188. Artificial Intelligence Algorithms (4)

This class will cover a broad spectrum of machine learning algorithms. It builds on studentsâ€™ previous exposure to machine learning. It covers new artificial intelligence algorithms ranging from topic models as used in the text data analysis to genetic algorithms.
